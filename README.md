### Three.js
I am currently in the process of splitting my large 3D web application ('Open Virtual Tours') into smaller, more manageable tools and experiences. Aside from that, I have some games in the works.

### Ideas
These are projects I'd like to build sometime in the future. They're free for the taking, just let me know if you start tackling one! I wanna see!

| Flashing lights detector for Windows and Linux | Desktop application that checks the render buffer to detect sharp contrasts in color, hue and saturation according to existing standards ('flashing lights') to block them. I don't think I can realistically work on this because I am sensitive to flashing lights, but I have a some research compiled that I can share. |
| Browsing Buddy | A little animated mascot that summarizes websites with AI and displays a timer to keep track of how much is left of your work day, giving you reminders to take breaks every hour and drink water. Extension for Chrome and Firefox. |
